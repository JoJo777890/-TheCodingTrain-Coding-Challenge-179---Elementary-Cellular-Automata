1. What can you do if you think about the CA system in terms of color?

2. What if you invent your own system with more than just two states?

3. What if the states are not discrete values, but continuous floating point numbers?

4. What other things can you do to visualize the CA system?

5. Could you have it be an infinite scroll?

6. Could you have the rules change over time?

7. There's too many possibilities for me to even think of.
